Our research focuses on developing an Anonymous Complaint Website that aims to strengthen communication and feedback within the school community. The system is designed not only for students, but also for faculty and staff members, providing them with a safe and secure platform to express concerns, suggestions, or ideas without fear of judgment or retaliation. The website includes the following features: 1. Anonymous Submission System – Users can submit feedback or complaints without the need to log in. For those who prefer a follow-up, an optional field for contact information is available. 2. Categories – Concerns are organized into categories such as Academics, Facilities (canteen, science lab, etc.), Student Discipline, Teachers & Staff, and Clubs & Activities. This makes it easier for administrators to identify the type of problem and assign it to the right department. 3. Dashboard for Admin (Restricted Access) – A private admin panel for authorized staff or student officers (e.g., SABAC) allows them to view reports, monitor concerns, and track the frequency of recurring issues. 4. Graphical Data Visualization – A graph is provided to show which categories receive the highest number of complaints, helping administrators prioritize the most urgent problems. 5. Suggestion Panel – Aside from complaints, users can also share positive ideas, proposals, or improvements (similar to a suggestion box). 6. FAQs Page – A dedicated section explains what kind of feedback is acceptable, how reports are processed, who reviews them, and the limits of anonymity. This helps manage expectations and builds trust among users. 7. Issue/Concern Monitor – A public table (without names) displays a list of submitted issues and their status: Pending, Under Review, or Resolved*. This feature ensures transparency and accountability by showing progress on existing concerns. 8. Resolved Complaints Section – A history of resolved issues is available to prove that concerns raised are not ignored, but acted upon. 9. Simple, Mobile-Friendly Design – Since most students use phones, the interface is built to be clean, responsive, and easy to navigate. 10. Security & Confidentiality Notice – A visible reminder assures users that their data is protected and handled responsibly, following the principles of the Data Privacy Act of 2012. Overall, the Anonymous Complaint Website is not just a complaint-gathering tool but a constructive communication platform. By combining anonymity, categorization, transparency, and accountability, it creates a safer and more responsive school environment for students, staff, and faculty members alike.
